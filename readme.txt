The project has been developed for PRODIGY INFOTECH as part of my internship task-2.
It analyzes Titanic Data influencing survival rates on the Titanic using the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The script reads a CSV file named "train.csv" & "test.csv" located in the specified directory and performs various data manipulations and visualizations.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

Instructions:
Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed on your system.
Download the "world_population.csv" file and place it in the directory specified in the script.
Execute the Python script.
Description:

Reading Data:

Conclusion

Note:
Make sure to adjust the file path if the location of the CSV file differs.
The script assumes the structure of the CSV file remains consistent with the provided data.
Feel free to modify the script as per your requirements or for different datasets.
